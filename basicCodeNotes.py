# variables are always mutable in Python
# variables that are supposed to be constant and immutable are in capitals but can still change

# tuples:

tup = (2, 5, 8, 90, 23)
# a tuple is immutable
# it is faster than an array but cant be changed

# sets:
s = {13, 23, 56, 31}
# a set doesn't keep things in the same order
# it doesn't support indexing
# it doesn't allow duplicates
# a set is even faster than a tuple

# boolean
True
False

# operators
+, -, /, *
==, <=, >=, !=
and, or, not
